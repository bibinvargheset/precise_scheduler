Frequently asked questions on the usage of precise_scheduler.
Did you get here using an 'old' link and expected to see more questions?

AttributeError: 'module' object has no attribute 'every'
--------------------------------------------------------

I'm getting

.. code-block:: text

    AttributeError: 'module' object has no attribute 'every'

when I try to use precise_scheduler.

This happens if your code imports the wrong ``precise_scheduler`` module.
Make sure you don't have a ``precise_scheduler.py`` file in your project that overrides the ``precise_scheduler`` module provided by this library.


ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'precise_scheduler'
---------------------------------------------------------

It seems python can't find the precise_scheduler package. Let's check some common causes.

Did you install precise_scheduler? If not, follow :doc:`installation`. Validate installation:

* Did you install using pip? Run ``pip3 list | grep precise_scheduler``. This should return ``precise_scheduler   0.6.0`` (or a higher version number)
* Did you install using apt? Run ``dpkg -l | grep python3-precise_scheduler``. This should return something along the lines of ``python3-precise_scheduler     0.3.2-1.1     Job scheduling for humans (Python 3)`` (or a higher version number)

Are you used python 3 to install precise_scheduler, and are running the script using python 3?
For example, if you installed precise_scheduler using a version of pip that uses Python 2, and your code runs in Python 3, the package won't be found.
In this case the solution is to install precise_scheduler using pip3: ``pip3 install precise_scheduler``.

Are you using virtualenv? Check that you are running the script inside the same virtualenv where you installed precise_scheduler.

Is this problem occurring when running the program from inside and IDE like PyCharm or VSCode?
Try to run your program from a commandline outside of the IDE.
If it works there, the problem is with your IDE configuration.
It might be that your IDE uses a different Python interpreter installation.

ModuleNotFoundError: ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'pytz'
----------------------------------------------------------------

This error happens when you try to set a timezone in ``.at()`` without having the `pytz <https://pypi.org/project/pytz/>`_ package installed.
Pytz is a required dependency when working with timezones.
To resolve this issue, install the ``pytz`` module by running ``pip install pytz``.

Does precise_scheduler support time zones?
------------------------------------------
Yes! See :doc:`Timezones <timezones>`.

What if my task throws an exception?
------------------------------------
See :doc:`Exception Handling <exception-handling>`.

How can I run a job only once?
------------------------------
See :doc:`Examples <examples>`.

How can I cancel several jobs at once?
--------------------------------------
See :doc:`Examples <examples>`.

How to execute jobs in parallel?
--------------------------------
See :doc:`Parallel Execution <parallel-execution>`.

How to continuously run the scheduler without blocking the main thread?
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
:doc:`Background Execution<background-execution>`.
